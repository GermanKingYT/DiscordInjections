# EmotesPlugin

You should place this file in the `Plugins` folder of the DiscordInjections project.

This plugin adds Twitch ad BTTV emotes to Discord, which are replaced every 15 seconds by default.

#### Note: your client might lag when it changes text to emotes. For this reason, BTTV Emotes are disabled by default. set `this.disableBTTV` to `false` to enable them.
